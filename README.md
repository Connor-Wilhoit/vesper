Open Source Deep Learning Library

This is very much a work in progress, and will serve as the base for a proper Deep-Learning library.
Most of the code is simply functions from the `carspeed-challenge` repo, simply split into individual files.

The directory structure is labeled as such, to somewhat replicate the homo sapien brain structure, but also to encourage critical thinking
when naming and placing files going forward.

Suggestions/ideas are much appreciated, and proper work on turning this into an actual Deep-Learning library that anyone can use will happen
sometime during summer 2019.
